# To-Do List App

A simple and elegant To-Do List application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a single click.
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them.
- Delete tasks using the delete (Ã—) button.
- Tasks persist in the browser's `localStorage`.

## File Structure
